Goal: Build a ChatGPT-like conversational interface for Kerala farmers that is simple, farmer-friendly, and mobile-first.

UI Style:

Looks like ChatGPT (clean chat interface, dark + light mode toggle).

Farmers type or use voice input in Malayalam/English.

AI assistant replies in simple language with icons/illustrations.

Large, farmer-friendly buttons and icons.

Core Features (Tabs / Sections):

AI Chat Tab (Main Chat – like ChatGPT)

Farmers can ask any farming-related question (crop care, fertilizer use, pest control, irrigation, etc.).

Voice input option + AI replies with both text + voice playback (for non-readers).

Local language (Malayalam) support.

Smart Suggestions Tab (Proactive Guidance)

AI automatically suggests what to do today / this week (planting, watering, spraying, harvesting).

Based on weather reports, crop type, and local data.

Push notifications + alerts for urgent tasks (e.g., “Heavy rain expected – cover seedlings” or “Best day to sell tomatoes in local market”).

Weather & Alerts Tab

Real-time weather updates (rain, temperature, wind).

AI gives recommendations based on weather (e.g., “Delay irrigation today, rain expected”).

Wildlife conflict alerts and crop protection tips.

Market & Labor Tab

Daily market price alerts for major crops in Kerala.

Guidance on best time to sell.

Access to labor cost calculators and nearby service providers (equipment rental, custom hiring centers).

Community Tab

Q&A forum where farmers can share experiences.

AI-assisted summaries of discussions.

Farmers can follow up with questions inside the chat.

Special Requirements:

Offline support (PWA-lite) so farmers can still see last saved advice without internet.

Voice-first experience (tap mic → ask → get answer).

Push Notifications for weather alerts, urgent crop actions, market price drops.

Icons + cards UI instead of long text (simple, visual guidance).

Colors: Green + earthy tones (farmer-friendly).

Font: Simple, large, easy to read (like Poppins or Nunito).
